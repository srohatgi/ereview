Howl: Enterprise Reviews
========================

Howl fills a vacuum in the enterprise product and sales marketplace. Similar to Amazon's customer reviews, Howl provides a way for enterprises and their customers to have an open dialog. This helps make the enterprise product and services market more competitive and grow at a much faster pace than now.

Salesforce's rich CRM and Support databases provide a unique and rare opportunity to build Howl (enterprise reviews) and become a *ubiquitous influence on enterprise market* as Amazon has over the retail product market or Yelp has over casual dining.

Mobile Application
------------------

Howl's user experience is to keep it simple: a search bar for searching across enterprise services and products and then a detail review page for the service/ product.

The search is done using Salesforce SOQL API on the Product table. We created a custom object Product_Review table for storing reviews. We used appery.io to build the mobile application, and wrote REST/ JSON services using nodejs.

Future Enhancements
-------------------

Build call to action on the detail review page. These could include:
- generating a lead
- starting a trial
- leaving a new review
